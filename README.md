Terms | Description
------|-------------
Landing Page | Standalone web page usually created for the purposes of marketing or advertising. It's where a visitor will "land" when clicking on an ad.
Parallax Scrolling | Web site trend where the background content (image/media) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Ex. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryhow_css_parallax_demo.htm
Snackbar | Usually a single line of text related to the operation performed. They may contain text but no icons. Snackbars animate from the bottom edge of the screen. Ex. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_snackbar.asp
Toasts | Similar to snackbar except they are primarily used for system messaging and may not be swiped off screen.
